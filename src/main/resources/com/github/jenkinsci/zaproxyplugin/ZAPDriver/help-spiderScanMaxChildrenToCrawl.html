Specify the 'Max Children to Crawl'. This parameter limits the number of children that will be crawled at every node in the tree. This is useful for data driven applications that have large numbers of 'pages' that are in fact exactly the same code but containing different data, for example from a database. By default this is set to zero which means there are no limits applied to the number of child nodes crawled.
