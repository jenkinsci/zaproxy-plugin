Spider target url or not.
The spider is a tool than is used to automatically discover new resources (URLs) on a particular Site.
It begins with a list of URLs to visit, called the seeds, which depends on how the Spider is started.
The Spider then visits these URLs, it identifies all the hyperlinks in the page and adds them to the list of URLs to visit 
and the process continues recursively as long as new resources are found.
Optional if a session is load.
