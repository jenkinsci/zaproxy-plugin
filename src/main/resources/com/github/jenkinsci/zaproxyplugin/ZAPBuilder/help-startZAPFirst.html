If checked, ZAProxy starts before all build steps (so, in a pre-build step).
This allows to follow interactions of an user on a webapp and receive all responses from it.
For example, you can start ZAProxy as a pre-build step, setup a Selenium build step that will navigate through a webapp.
ZAProxy will capture events and after that, you can setup a ZAProxy build step to scan url found in Selenium step.
<p>Be careful, the ZAProxy build step must be placed after the Selenium build step.</p>
