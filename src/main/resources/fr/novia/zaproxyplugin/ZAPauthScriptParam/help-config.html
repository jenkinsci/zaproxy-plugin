These fields allow you to add "Authentication Script Parameter(s)" which will be part of the "scriptBasedConfig" string passed to the setAuthenticationMethod, hence sent to the ZAP API to be used along with the script.
You just have to type the parameter name in the first field and its corresponding value (if any) in the opposing field. You don't have to add assignation or concatenation symbols i.e. "=" or "&", this will be handled automatically.
